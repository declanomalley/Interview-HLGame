## TODO

add unit tests for saving high score
add unit test for retrieving high score
display highscore on board
capture name and fill hiddenfield

## The Game

Generate a random number between 1-100 and show it to the user

Ask the user to guess whether the next one will be higher or lower

Generate a new random number between 1-100, which cannot be the same as the previous one

If the user is correct give them 1 point

If the user is incorrect the game finishes

When the user reaches 10 points then have completed the game so congratulate them!

When a game finishes give the user the option to play again

Record the top three high scores, including overall time – you’ll need to prompt for a username at some point during the game

Use the time to split equal scores – faster is better

The high scores should be persisted, so they are available every time the game is run

## Notes

This exercise is expected to take between 2-4 hours to complete. If you run out of time then add notes into a readme file so we can see where you wanted to go with it

Don’t use a full-blown DB to record high scores, something like a local text file will do

Consider that this may become a worldwide phenomenon and require a DB at some point

We may want to change the point scoring system in the future i.e. points required to win, number of points awarded for a correct guess, etc.

A UI is not necessary but will earn extra kudos, although a console app is fine though and won’t be scored down.

On the first run there will be no high score list

## Submission

The solution should be written in either C# or Angular
